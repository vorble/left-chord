# Left Chord

Prototype left-hand-only input mechanisms for US keyboards.

## Brief

* Space is the upper modifier key. Press space and a key to produce the upper version of that key.
* Keys 1, 2, 3, 4, q, w, e, r, a, s, d, f, z, x, c, and v are the primary input keys. Press one of these to produce the letter.
* Pairs of keys are pressed to access the right portions of the keyboard.
* The order of key presses matters, e.g. press 12 for 5, 21 for 6, 23 for 7, etc.
* Tab is the symbol modifier key and works with key pairs. Accepted key pairs start at 2, w, s, x due to limitations of keyboards where tab and 1, q, a, z don't allow a third key press to be recognized.
